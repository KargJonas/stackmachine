### Stackmachine Instruction Set Architecture ###

const
  pushes the value from progmem which is right
  after const onto the stack
  adds one stack item

dup
  duplicates the topmost stack item

drop
  removes the topmost stack item

read
  reads one byte from stdin onto the stack
  adds one stack item

print
  puts one byte from the stack into stdout
  consumes the last stack item

jmp
  sets the pc to last value on the stack
  consumes the last stack item

bnz
  jumps if the last stack item is nonzero
  consumes the last stack item

lss
  consumes two stack items and adds 1 onto the stack
  if the first one is less than the second one,
  otherwise adds a 0

add
  adds the last two items fromthe stack together,
  removes these items from the stack,
  and adds the result to the stack

sub
  like add but with subtraction
